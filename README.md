# WYNO Anti-Cheat

## Project Overview
WYNO Anti-Cheat is an advanced kernel driver designed to detect and prevent cheating in games by monitoring running processes and blacklisting known malicious software. The driver can also randomize hardware identifiers through a hardware spoofing mechanism to protect users from being flagged by anti-cheat systems. Alerts can be sent to a Discord webhook in real-time when suspicious activity is detected.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- A Linux kernel development environment
- Kernel headers and build tools
- `gcc`, `make`, and other build essentials

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/wyno-anti-cheat.git
    cd wyno-anti-cheat
    ```

2. **Build the kernel module**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Load the module**:
    ```bash
    sudo insmod wino_driver.ko webhook=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url enable_spoofing=true 
    ```

4. **Check `dmesg` for logs** to ensure the driver is running:
    ```bash
    dmesg | tail
    ```

5. **Configure the system** according to your requirements. Modify the `config.json` for initial settings.

## Usage
The driver runs in the background and automatically scans for blacklisted processes based on configured intervals. The Discord webhook will receive alerts whenever a cheat is detected or a process is terminated. Configuration can be done through the `config.html` web interface or by directly editing `config.json`.

### Configuration Options
- **Discord Webhook URL**: Specify your webhook URL to receive alerts.
- **Process Names**: Define the list of known cheat process names to monitor.
- **Blacklisted Driver Hashes**: List known malicious driver hashes to be flagged.
- **Scan Interval**: Adjust the frequency of scans based on system performance and security needs.

## Features
- **Real-time Cheating Detection**: Scans processes in real-time and terminates known cheats.
- **Discord Integration**: Sends alerts to a designated Discord channel.
- **Hardware Spoofing**: Randomizes hardware identifiers to prevent detection.
- **Configurable Scan Intervals**: Customizable scanning frequency for performance optimization.
- **Web-based Dashboard**: Offers a graphical user interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Dependencies
The following packages are required (if specified in a `package.json`):
- [Any additional libraries or development tools if applicable]
